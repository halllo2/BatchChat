# BatchChat
A online chat written in Batch, uses also Powershell and VBScript.
Chat without setting up LAN ports or changing firewalls.
Report bugs here or via Discord

WIP Version 1.1
* Fixed commandline showing up when starting the chat
* Removed junk from code

TO DO:
* More chatrooms/Create your own chatroom
* When someone creates his account, it will automaticly join the main chatroom
* Encrypt messages
* Faster looping time when there are more accounts
* Encrypt password
* Add commands for admins: (UN) Ban/Kick/Mute/Warn
* Change me to status
* Exit silent possible
* Add command: info

To consider:
* Use the chat in 1 screen instead of 2
* Send IP with message encrypted? So you can get banned with your IP. 
* Add a way to log the chat (/history)
